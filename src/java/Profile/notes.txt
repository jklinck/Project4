Here are the methods I have added to the data structures that came with the project.

DirectedGraph
removeUser

Methods I didn't end up needing

Profile - getUserObject
ProfileManager - getUser
Main - displayAll

I removed some unused imports but didn't remove the linkedQueue.java from ProfileManager.java
