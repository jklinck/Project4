The issue with calling breadFirstTraversal when selection == 2 is that when
two users are connected in selection == 3 is only connecting the users inside
the friendsArray and not adding them to the graph. I need to alter addFriends in
Profile.java so it calls connectFriends from ProfileManager. That way the two
Profiles will be connected in the graph.

Maybe the addFriend method in Profile.java should have three parameters (ProfileManager, Profile, Profile)
ProfileManager is the graph and then two Profile objects that are the friends being connected.
